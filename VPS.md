# Virtual Private Server (VPS)

## Terminologies

- **Server**: A server is a powerful computer that stores all the data and files for a website. When you type a domain name into your browser, that server delivers the site to your screen.
- **Virtual**: Virtualization technology splits one full server into multiple virtual machines. It’s still one physical piece of hardware, but it operates like several separate servers.
- **Private**: The word private is just what it sounds like. Your virtual server and all its virtual resources are reserved just for you, giving you a high-performance hosting environment where the [RAM](https://www.dreamhost.com/glossary/hosting/ram/), [CPU](https://www.dreamhost.com/glossary/hosting/cpu/) power, or any data will not be shared with other users.

## Definition

- VPS, acts as an isolated, virtual environment on a physical server
- VPS hosting uses virtualization technology to split a single physical machine into multiple private server environments that share the resources
- get dedicated server space with a reserved amount of resources, offering greater control and customization than shared hosting
- hosting provider installs a hypervisor—a virtual layer—on top of the operating system (OS) of the physical server that divides it into virtual compartments

## **Different types of web hosting services available**

- **Shared hosting** is when multiple users share a single physical server and all of its resources. However, you are not allocated a set amount of resources, meaning your website’s computing power and memory can be affected by the needs of other users.

- **Dedicated hosting**, on the hand, provides an entire physical server and all of its resources are reserved for your business alone. You get full control over everything, from hardware to operating system to custom server software.

- **VPS hosting** sits at the midpoint between shared hosting and dedicated hosting. Unlike shared hosting, you get a defined amount of resources allocated to your VPS. Plus, you can enjoy many advantages of dedicated hosting for a more affordable price, including your own OS, server applications, and root access control
