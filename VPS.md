# Virtual Private Server (VPS)

## Terminologies

- **Server**: A server is a powerful computer that stores all the data and files for a website. When you type a domain name into your browser, that server delivers the site to your screen.
- **Virtual**: Virtualization technology splits one full server into multiple virtual machines. It’s still one physical piece of hardware, but it operates like several separate servers.
- **Private**: The word private is just what it sounds like. Your virtual server and all its virtual resources are reserved just for you, giving you a high-performance hosting environment where the [RAM](https://www.dreamhost.com/glossary/hosting/ram/), [CPU](https://www.dreamhost.com/glossary/hosting/cpu/) power, or any data will not be shared with other users.

## Definition

- VPS, acts as an isolated, virtual environment on a physical server
- VPS hosting uses virtualization technology to split a single physical machine into multiple private server environments that share the resources
- get dedicated server space with a reserved amount of resources, offering greater control and customization than shared hosting
- hosting provider installs a hypervisor—a virtual layer—on top of the operating system (OS) of the physical server that divides it into virtual compartments

## **Different types of web hosting services available**

- **Shared hosting** is when multiple users share a single physical server and all of its resources. However, you are not allocated a set amount of resources, meaning your website’s computing power and memory can be affected by the needs of other users.
- **Dedicated hosting**, on the hand, provides an entire physical server and all of its resources are reserved for your business alone. You get full control over everything, from hardware to operating system to custom server software.
- **VPS hosting** sits at the midpoint between shared hosting and dedicated hosting. Unlike shared hosting, you get a defined amount of resources allocated to your VPS. Plus, you can enjoy many advantages of dedicated hosting for a more affordable price, including your own OS, server applications, and root access control

## Types of VPS hosting

1. **Unmanaged VPS: Recommended for those who have technical background**
   - Installing software, your control panel and taking care of software updates.
   - Monitoring for security threats, installing security patches and fixing error messages.
   - In the event of an outage or hardware failure you won’t get much if any support from your host.
   - Configuring and maintaining your server including any upgrades you might want to see.
   - You take over the responsibility of setting up your sites backup services.
2. **Managed VPS:**
   - **Initial server setup**
     When you launch your site with a VPS there are a few steps to take in order to set the server up including installing your control panel, server software and installing any applications and your operating system. A managed host will take care of this.
   - **Updates**
     Similarly, all applications and OS updates, and ongoing fine tuning of the server will be handled for you.
   - **Security patches**
     Security patches for your OS and core server software are installed and updated, on your behalf.
   - **Monitoring**
     Monitors for early warning signs of hardware failure and malicious attack
   - **Automated backups**
     In the event anything goes wrong with your site, you can retrieve it back to an earlier version.
